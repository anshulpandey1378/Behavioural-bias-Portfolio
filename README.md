# Behavioural Finance-Based Portfolio Construction

## Project Overview

This project analyzes the relationship between investor psychology, required return, and portfolio construction.

The objective was to evaluate investors’ risk tolerance and behavioural tendencies, identify cognitive and emotional biases, and construct customized portfolios aligned with their financial goals and investment horizon.

The study integrates principles of Behavioural Finance with practical asset allocation strategies.

Asset allocation based on risk-return alignment and behavioural profile.

### 5. Rebalancing Strategy  
Periodic review and rebalancing recommendations to maintain allocation discipline.
